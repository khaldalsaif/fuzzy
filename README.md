# fuzzy is fuzzing dirictory tool build with python
The process of working
you will input url for example "scanme.org.nmap"
then you should of put the path of the list that you want to fuzz with 
for example if you entered "fuzzingpayload.txt" which I provided with the project 
it will fuzz on each word untill it return the status of the path ex(200,403..etc)
if the path exists
